<p>These are strange times for everyone, and especially musicians. Musicians have been furloughed, auditions have been postponed, gigs are hard to find, and most people's general schedule has been disrupted. To add on to that, the seemingly constant stream of depressing news does nothing to help with motivation to practice. What I'm coming to realize is that it’s OK if this is not the most productive time in your life. It doesn't have to be. But if you are wanting to practice more, here are some tips that might help.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Manage Expectations</h2>

<p>2020 very well might be the most stressful year that any one of us will ever experience in our lifetimes. At least, it is the most stressful that we have experienced so far. Some people have reacted to being stuck inside as a rare opportunity to practice harder than ever before, and I have to admit that I was NOT one of those people. I quickly found that I am most productive in my practicing while at school, constantly surrounded by music and hearing classmates diligently practicing at every turn. Also, the stress and heartache that I often feel when I read the news is sometimes too overwhelming to process and causes me to shut down. If you're anything like me, you have a voice in your head guilt-tripping you when you don't practice as much as you think you should. Normally, this voice is helpful in motivating me to practice when I don't feel like it, but with so much other stuff going on, this can be counter-productive by diminishing self-esteem, leading to more negative feelings, and turning into a vicious cycle. This quarantine, I am working on increasing my practice time through ways other than guilt. The key is setting up an environment that encourages practice and sustainable and consistent improvement.</p>

<p>*Many of the following tips are derived from James Clear's book <em>Atomic Habits</em>, which I highly recommend!*</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Create and Environment that Encourages Practicing</h2>

<p>Something I believed for years was that I should always feel motivated to practice. If I didn't feel like practicing, there was something wrong with me, or I didn't love the flute enough, or I wouldn't make it. Looking back, I recognize how ridiculous that is! Imagine if we only brushed our teeth when we felt motivated, or only went to class or work when we felt motivated. We would stink, have bad grades, and get fired from our jobs! Once we get to the level of taking professional orchestra auditions, we must practice even when we don't want to. And let me tell you, I don’t always want to.</p>

<p>Essentially what we're doing here is <em>making it easier to practice.</em></p>

<p>The goal is to make practicing a habit. In James Clear’s <em>Atomic Habits</em>, he breaks down a habit into three parts: Cue, Response, and Reward. At school, I usually break my practice time up between other commitments, like classes and rehearsals. So the cue was free time between other commitments combined with hearing other people practicing at school or in the dorms. During quarantine without a set schedule or being able to hear my classmates practicing,&nbsp;the best ways I've found to cue my practice time are:</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Put your instrument out and ready where you can easily see it</h4>

<p>Before it got too hot to bear, I was practicing in my bedroom. Every morning after I woke up, I had a clear view of my practice area. This would help to remind me to practice and focus the day on meeting my practice goals.</p>

<h4 class= "section-heading">Have as much set up and ready to go as possible</h4>

<p>Similar to the above, this helps eliminate one more obstacle in the way of me practicing. If my music, tuner, pencil, etc. are all out and ready to go, it's one less excuse to procrastinate before practicing.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Build around other, already-established habits</h4>

<p>Making my bed every morning is a habit I’ve built over the years. This has become an integral part of my morning routine; if I don’t make my bed right after getting up, my day feels like it didn’t start right, and I eventually go back and do it. So, to work towards building an environment that encourages practicing by removing as many obstacles as I can to getting started, I added the habit of getting my flute out and ready to play into this already-established morning routine.</p>    

<p>It works like this:</p>

<p>Get out of bed, cue --&gt; make my bed, cue --&gt; get my flute out. This way, after I finish breakfast there is even one less few obstacle in the way of applying flute to face.</p>

<p>Take stock of the habits you already have. Trust me, even if you don’t realize it, <em>everyone</em> has habits they carry out daily. This could mean a morning coffee, general times you eat your meals, checking various social media after waking up, a work schedule, an exercise routine, a TV show schedule, etc. Build practice habits around the habits you already (maybe unconsciously) have.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Play music you like!</h4>

<p>If dreading long tones and scales is what's holding you back from starting, then start with music you enjoy playing. Once you get the ball rolling, it's a lot easier to go back and do the mundane stuff :)</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Break It Up!</h2>

<p>I break up my practice time in two major ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Breaking up my time in conjunction with what I know about myself. For example, I know that I am most disciplined in the morning, tend to get sleepy in the afternoon, and usually have a burst of energy in the evening. So I&rsquo;ll try to frontload in the morning, then break the remaining time up between afternoon and evening. For example, if I want to practice 4 hours in a day, I&rsquo;ll aim for 2 hours in the morning, 1 hour in the afternoon, and 1 hour in the evening.</li><br>
    <li>Then, break those chunks into even smaller chunks. If I really don&rsquo;t feel like practicing on a given day, I&rsquo;ve found success in using the Pomodoro Technique: 20 min practice, 5 (or I sometimes do 10) min break. Repeat for an hour of practice time. Then take a longer break until the next time chunk. To stick with this, I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to use the timer on my phone, or even a kitchen timer if I find I&rsquo;m getting too distracted by using my phone. You do have to be disciplined about not going overtime on your break!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here's a complete breakdown of the 4 hour practice day example using Pomodoro Technique, for days when I really don’t feel like practicing:</strong></p>

<p><strong>MORNING</strong></p>

<p>7:30am: wake up, scroll through my phone for a bit, make my bed, get the flute out, eat breakfast, drink coffee</p>

<p>8:30-8:50am: practice, then 5-10 min break (usually the first session of the day is the hardest, so I&rsquo;ll sometimes opt for a slightly longer break)</p>

<p>9-9:20am: practice, then 5 min break</p>

<p>9:25-9:45am: practice</p>

<p>9:45am: longer break. If this is a day when I truly don&rsquo;t feel like practicing, I usually will feel frustrated/angsty at this point, which means it&rsquo;s a great time to let it out through some cardio!! So, I like to either spend some time with my bike trainer or go for a run, then take a quick shower. I always feel better after cardio, so on to more practice&hellip;</p>

<p>11-11:20am: practice, then 5 min break</p>

<p>11:25-11:45am: practice, then 5 min break</p>

<p>11:50am-12:10pm: practice</p>

<p>TOTAL PRACTICE TIME: 2 HOURS</p>

<p><strong>AFTERNOON</strong></p>

<p>12:10pm: lunchtime</p>

<p>1pm: Pomodoro technique for another hour of practice</p>

<p>TOTAL PRACTICE TIME: 3 HOURS</p>

<p><strong>EVENING</strong></p>

<p>~7pm (right after dinner): Pomodoro technique for another hour of practice.</p>

<p>TOTAL PRACTICE TIME: 4 HOURS</p>

<p>Note: Using the Pomodoro Technique, by telling myself "I only have to practice 20 minutes," I am much, much more likely to pick up the flute than if I tell myself I have to practice for an hour. And often once I start practicing, I'll want to keep going for more than 20 minutes at a time!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Prevent Negative Thought Cycles and Mindless Time-Sucks as much as Possible</h2>

<p>As I said earlier, the happenings in the world are sometimes overwhelming for me. And often when I’m in a bad headspace, I tend to do things that end up making me feel even worse. While I think it's important to stay informed, I have to remind myself that any one person can't carry the weight of the whole world on their shoulders, and I believe the world benefits most from us each realizing our own potential. So, there must be a balance between staying up-to-date and preserving enough mental bandwidth to be able to work towards daily goals and ultimately realizing your own potential.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Be aware of how your mood changes depending on the type of content you consume.</h4>

<p>Everyone has a right to what kind of and how much content they consume. Use this fact to your advantage! For example, if you find that spending time on Facebook often makes you feel worse than before, consciously decide to limit your time on Facebook. If reading an inspiring auto-biography makes you feel like you can conquer the world, consider reading 5-10 minutes during your Pomodoro practice breaks!</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Realize that many platforms we spend too much time on are intentionally designed to be addicting.</h4>

<p>Have you ever logged on to a social media platform and after a while, you&nbsp;want to log off, but for the life of you just can't seem to stop scrolling? Or you sit down to relax for a few minutes on your phone or in front of the TV or computer and before you know it, a few hours have passed? Let me tell you, that's not a mistake. The companies behind these apps, games, websites, and streaming services profit more off of you the more time you keep scrolling and clicking. News outlets run sensationalized stories to draw you in and get more views. Streaming platforms make more money off of you the more ads you watch and subscriptions you buy. I've had to ask myself: <strong>Is it worth sacrificing my time, mood, and productivity (which, combined, will ultimately play a large part in deciding <em>my own</em> earning capacity) for a stranger's monetary gain?</strong> Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting everyone delete all their social media accounts or never watch TV ever again. Sometimes these platforms can be useful in helping me relax, bond with friends over shared interests, or even in finding motivating content. The key is using these platforms consciously and intentionally. Which is why I've found it helpful to...</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Set time constraints on the media you consume.</h4>

<p>As an Android user (don’t come for me), I've become a fan of using Digital Wellbeing settings to set timers on certain apps and websites I frequent. Looking at my time spent on my phone some days has been a humbling experience... so setting timers even just to be aware of how much time I'm spending on apps and websites is super helpful. iPhone users, do whatever it is you do!!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Track Your Practice Time</h2>

<p>This process requires you to be fully honest with yourself and accept wherever you are at without judgment. This is the most effective way I’ve found for myself to really look at my habits and help identify small tweaks to improve towards my larger goal. Recently I’ve found success in creating a Google Sheets doc for each month to track my time spent practicing each day for that month. If it’s 0 for that day, or week, or month, it’s 0! To accept where you’re at now, right now in this moment, without judgment, is the way to move forward with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>I created a shortcut from Google Drive onto the Home Screen of my phone, so after I practice for a chunk, all I have to do is click the shortcut to enter in the number of minutes/hours I just practiced, then repeat for each additional chunk I practice, adding to the day’s total.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Create a Consistent Sleep Schedule, and Stick to it Like Your Life Depends on it</h4>

<p>If I have plans to practice a lot the following day, it is so important that I get enough good sleep the night before to prepare for the next day. The key here is having a solid nighttime routine. I set a timer on my phone an hour-ish before I want to go to sleep to remind me to start getting ready for bed. I make sure I don’t eat a lot after dinner because that decreases my sleep quality. I make sure to get my body in bed before my bedtime so that I have time to fall asleep. I put my phone on Do Not Disturb and set an alarm for the next morning.</p>

<p>Now let's break this whole thing down...</p>

<h1 class="section-heading">The Process, in Steps</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Think of your long-term goal. Is it to play in an orchestra? To be a soloist? Chamber musician? Come up with the steps it will take you to get there. How many hours a day will you need to practice? What school or teacher will help you get there? What techniques do you need to improve? What rep do you need to master?</li>
    <li>Evaluate where you are at. Be completely honest with yourself. If you haven&rsquo;t practiced for a month, you haven&rsquo;t practiced for a month. If you planned to practice 4 hours today but only ended up doing 20 minutes, then that&rsquo;s what happened. If you planned to practice 2 hours and practiced 3, great! No judgment. Don&rsquo;t estimate, either. Don&rsquo;t round up your time spent practicing because you&rsquo;re embarrassed. Be radically accepting of yourself. There are only things that work and things that don&rsquo;t work.</li>
    <li>Try some of the methods suggested here. I can almost guarantee you it won&rsquo;t go perfectly, or they might not fit to your schedule or preference. That&rsquo;s part of the process!</li>
    <li>Notice patterns that lead to either more practicing or less practicing. Approach this step with a sense of curiosity. What worked, and what didn&rsquo;t? Why or why not? Take the things that worked, and plan to incorporate them for the next day. Take the things that didn&rsquo;t work, and plan to try out a different approach.</li>
    <li>Get a good night&rsquo;s rest, then execute the plan you made for the day to the best of your ability.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 2-5 until you&rsquo;re consistently maintaining your daily goals. Accept that it may never be perfect but remember that by working to improve, you are beating your old self by miles. This will almost certainly show in your practice log: even if you don&rsquo;t hit your daily goal every day, your total practice time (and self-satisfaction) will almost certainly increase over time. Be proud of the fact that you are putting in effort to improve!</li>
</ol>
