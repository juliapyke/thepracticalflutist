<p>These are strange times for everyone, and especially musicians. Musicians have been furloughed, auditions have been postponed, gigs are hard to find, and most people's general schedule has been disrupted. To add on to that, the seemingly constant stream of depressing news does nothing to help with motivation to practice. What I'm coming to realize is that it’s OK if this is not the most productive time in your life. It doesn't have to be. But if you are wanting to practice more, here are some tips that might help.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Manage Expectations</h2>

<p>2020 very well might be the most stressful year that any one of us will ever experience in our lifetimes. At the very least, it's the only global pandemic any of us has lived to see. Some people have reacted to being stuck inside as a rare opportunity to practice harder than ever before, which I respect, but I have to admit that I was NOT one of those people. I quickly found that I am most productive in my practicing while at school, constantly surrounded by music and hearing classmates diligently practicing at every turn. Also, the stress and heartache that I often feel when I read the news is sometimes too overwhelming to process and causes me to shut down.</p>
<p>Now I want to say that I've been lucky not to have any family who has gotten COVID and have been healthy myself. For people who are taking care of themselves, family, or friends, dealing with wildfires, or responding to their calling to the frontlines of protests to make the world a more equitable and just place, I want to recognize that that is productive in itself. This article is intended for those who have felt the desire to practice more but feel stuck.</p>
<p>I've had to manage my expectations about practicing this quarantine, and it feels like I've gone back to square one and have to find ways to work back up to what I was doing before the pandemic. I came into quarantine thinking that I should be practicing just as much as or even more than I was before. This proved to yield very inconsistent and disappointing results. After lots of guilt and wallowing over feeling lazy because I just couldn't seem to keep up what I was doing before quarantine, I've switched my goal to practicing <em>consistently</em>, even if it means starting with a goal of no less than 20 minutes per day, then, after reaching that goal consistently, increasing my daily practice goal day to day or week to week. Ironically, this new approach actually brought me consistent results more in line with what I was doing before the pandemic, and has given me a much better mindset.</p>
<p>If you're anything like me, you have a voice in your head guilt-tripping you when you don't practice as much as you think you should. Normally, this voice is helpful in motivating me to practice when I don't feel like it, but with so much other stuff going on, this can be counter-productive by diminishing my self-esteem, leading to more negative feelings, leading to less practicing, and rinse and repeat. This quarantine, I am working on increasing my practice time through ways other than guilt. Because, I don't think I deserve to feel guilty for how I instinctively react to the world burning (figuratively <em>and</em> literally). But I also know that I feel overall happier, more optimistic, and more powerful when I put in time and effort towards my goals. The key is setting up an <em>environment</em> that encourages practice and sustainable and consistent improvement.</p>

<p>*Many of the following tips are derived from James Clear's book <a href="https://amzn.to/3kQMooC" target="_blank"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a>, which I highly recommend!*<span class="caption text-muted" style="text-align: left;">As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.</span></p>



<h2 class="section-heading">Create an Environment that Encourages Practicing</h2>

<p>Something I believed for years was that I should always feel motivated to practice. If I didn't want to practice, there was something wrong with me, or I didn't love the flute enough, or I wouldn't make it. Looking back, I recognize how ridiculous that is! Do you always feel motivated to do things you know you have to do? Imagine if we only brushed our teeth when we felt motivated, or only went to class or work when we felt motivated. We would stink, fail our classes, and get fired from our jobs! In order to reach our musical goals, we must practice even when we don't want to. And let me tell you, I don’t always want to.</p>

<p>The best way to practice consistently, even when you don't feel like it, is to make practicing into a habit. In James Clear’s <em>Atomic Habits</em>, he breaks down a habit into four stages: <a href="https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change#:~:text=All%20habits%20proceed%20through%20four,brain%20to%20initiate%20a%20behavior." target="_blank">Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward</a>. Very simply, in practicing terms:<br>
<strong>Cue</strong>=something that triggers you to practice (ie. seeing your instrument, a reminder on your phone to practice, hearing music, a thought);<br>
<strong>Craving</strong>=craving a reward you get out of practicing (ie. the joy you feel when you play that piece you love, a desire to complete your daily practice goal, the satisfaction that comes after a good practice session);<br>
<strong>Response</strong>=practicing (or, no response=not practicing, and the habit formation stops here);<br>
<strong>Reward</strong>=you satfisfy your craving (ie. you feel accomplished as a result of working towards your daily goal, you got joy out of playing that piece you love).</p>

<p>You can read more in the article linked above, but Clear goes on to say that whether or not we respond (read: practice) after experiencing a cue and craving depends on "how motivated you are and how much <em>friction</em> is associated with the behavior (emphasis added). If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won't do it."</p>
    
<p>At school, I usually break my practice time up between other commitments, like classes and rehearsals. So my cue was free time between other commitments combined with hearing other people practicing at school or in the dorms. During quarantine, those cues no longer exist. So, the things I needed to adapt as a result of being stuck inside in a new environment were my <strong>Cue</strong> and the <em>friction</em> associated with practicing. These are the most tangible parts of habit formation that I found I had control over. By finding new <strong>Cues</strong> and removing as much <em>friction</em> as I could that was preventing my <strong>Cue</strong> and <strong>Craving</strong> from resulting in a <strong>Response</strong>, I found that my practice time increased significantly and stayed much more consistent than before. Essentially what we want to do here is <em>make it easier to practice.</em> The best ways I've found to cue my practice time and get to it with minimal interruptions are:</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Put your instrument/practice equipment somewhere you can easily see it</h4>

<p>For a while, I was practicing in my bedroom. Every morning after I woke up, one of the first things I was was my practice area. This visual would help remind me to practice and would help focus the day on meeting my practice goals.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Set cues to practice on your phone</h4>

<p>I use Google Calendar to plan out my days, including my practice time, and have notifications on my events. This way when I'm scrolling through my phone, I'll get notifications when it's almost time to practice. This is an example of a cue! Another way to set up cues with your phone is by following musicians or practice accounts on social media. That way, every time you see a musician you admire or encounter a post of someone practicing, you'll get a cue to practice yourself.</p>

<h4 class= "section-heading">Have as much set up and ready to go as possible</h4>

<p>This helps eliminate one more obstacle in the way of me practicing. If my music, tuner, pencil, etc. are all out and ready to go, it's one less excuse to procrastinate before practicing. Consider setting up your practice area the night before, or in conjunction with other habits you already have...</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Build around the habits you already have</h4>

<p>Making my bed every morning is a habit I’ve built over the years. This has become an integral part of my morning routine; if I don’t make my bed right after getting up, my day feels like it didn’t start right, and I eventually go back and do it. So, to work towards building an environment that encourages practicing by removing as many obstacles as I can to getting started, I added the habit of getting my flute out and ready to play into my established morning routine.</p>    

<p>It works like this:</p>

<p>Get out of bed, cue --&gt; make my bed, cue --&gt; get my flute out. This way, after I finish breakfast and it's time to practice, my flute is already out so there is even one less few obstacle in the way of applying flute to face.</p>

<p>Take stock of the habits you already have. Trust me, even if you don’t realize it, <em>everyone</em> has habits they carry out daily. This could mean a morning coffee, general times you eat your meals, checking various social media after waking up, a work schedule, an exercise routine, a TV show schedule, etc. Build practice habits around the habits you already (maybe unconsciously) have.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Play music you like!</h4>

<p>If dreading long tones and scales is what's holding you back from starting, then start with music you enjoy playing. Once you get the ball rolling, it's a lot easier to go back and do the more mundane stuff :)</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Break It Up!</h2>

<p>I break up my practice time in two major ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li>On a larger scale, I break up my time in conjunction with what I know about myself. For example, I know that I am most disciplined in the morning, tend to get sleepy in the afternoon, and usually have a burst of energy in the evening. So I&rsquo;ll try to frontload in the morning, then break the remaining time up between afternoon and evening. For example, if I want to practice 4 hours in a day, I&rsquo;ll aim for 2 hours in the morning, 1 hour in the afternoon, and 1 hour in the evening. Adjust this based on your own tendencies. If you're more of a night owl, plan to practice more in the evening. Go with what works for you and make it easier on yourself!</li>
    <br>
    <li>Then, break those chunks into even smaller chunks. If I really don&rsquo;t feel like practicing on a given day, I&rsquo;ve found success in using the Pomodoro Technique: 20 min practice, 5 (or I sometimes do 10) min break. Repeat for an hour of practice time. Then take a longer break until the next time chunk. To stick with this, I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to use the timer on my phone, or even a kitchen timer if I find I&rsquo;m getting too distracted by using my phone. You do have to be disciplined about not going overtime on your breaks! Using the Pomodoro Technique, by telling myself "I only have to practice 20 minutes," I am much, much more likely to pick up the flute than if I tell myself I have to practice for an hour. And often once I start practicing, I'll want to keep going for more than 20 minutes at a time!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here's a complete breakdown of the 4 hour practice day example using Pomodoro Technique, frontloaded in the morning, for days when I really don’t feel like practicing:</strong></p>

<p><strong>MORNING</strong></p>

<p>7:30am: wake up, scroll through my phone for a bit, make my bed, get the flute out, eat breakfast, drink coffee</p>

<p>8:30-8:50am: practice, then 5-10 min break (usually the first session of the day is the hardest, so I&rsquo;ll sometimes opt for a slightly longer break)</p>

<p>9-9:20am: practice, then 5 min break</p>

<p>9:25-9:45am: practice</p>

<p>9:45am: longer break. If this is a day when I truly don&rsquo;t feel like practicing, I usually will feel frustrated/angsty at this point, which means it&rsquo;s a great time to let it out through some cardio!! So, I like to either spend some time with my bike trainer or go for a run, then take a quick shower. I always feel better after cardio, so on to more practice&hellip;</p>

<p>11-11:20am: practice, then 5 min break</p>

<p>11:25-11:45am: practice, then 5 min break</p>

<p>11:50am-12:10pm: practice</p>

<p>TOTAL PRACTICE TIME: 2 HOURS</p>

<p><strong>AFTERNOON</strong></p>

<p>12:10pm: lunchtime</p>

<p>1pm: Pomodoro technique for another hour of practice</p>

<p>TOTAL PRACTICE TIME: 3 HOURS</p>

<p><strong>EVENING</strong></p>

<p>~7pm (right after dinner): Pomodoro technique for another hour of practice.</p>

<p>TOTAL PRACTICE TIME: 4 HOURS</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Track Your Practice Time, and be Completely Honest</h2>

<p>Recently I’ve found success in creating a Google Sheets doc for each month to track my time spent practicing each day for that month. If it’s 0 for that day, or week, or month, it’s 0! To accept where you’re at now, right now in this moment, without judgment, is the way to move forward with a clear conscience. This process requires you to be fully honest with yourself and accept wherever you are at, because wherever you're at is just how it is. Otherwise, if I shame myself for not practicing as much as I feel like I should, it can create a negative spiral where I end up practicing even less which is NOT PRODUCTIVE! Or fun.</p>

<p>I created a shortcut from Google Drive onto the Home Screen of my phone, so after I practice for a chunk, all I have to do is click the shortcut to enter in the number of minutes/hours I just practiced, then repeat for each additional chunk I practice, adding to the day’s total. When you have a practice log like this that you update consistently, it's easy to see where you're at and where you could work to improve. The numbers don't lie!!</p>

<p>If you're having trouble identifying where your day went off track, consider tracking what you did and for how long for the whole day. I use Google Calendar for this. In the evening, go through your day chronologically in your head and add events for each thing you did, from the time you woke up until the current moment. There should be no gaps in the day's schedule because you're always doing something!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Create a Consistent Sleep Schedule</h2>

<p>If I have plans to practice a lot the following day, it is so important that I get enough good sleep the night before. There are some great tips <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/healthy-sleep-tips" target="_blank">here</a> for improving sleep hygiene and creating a consistent sleep schedule from the National Sleep Foundation.</p>
<p>A consistent sleep schedule takes me about a week to implement until my body gets used to going to bed around the same time every night and waking up at the same time every morning. What's made the biggest impact for me is setting a recurring alarm that goes off at the same time every morning (even weekends), and solidifying my nighttime routine. I set an alarm on my phone an hour-ish before I want to go to sleep to remind me to start getting ready for bed. I make sure I don’t eat a lot after dinner because I know from experience that that decreases my sleep quality. I get myself in bed before my bedtime so that I have time to fall asleep, and set my phone to Do Not Disturb.</p> 

<p>If you're looking for my number one tip to increasing and improving your practice time, this is it. Good sleep will help with every tip in this post...aaaand will probably change your life.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Prevent Negative Thought Cycles and Mindless Time-Sucks as much as Possible</h2>

<p>As I said earlier, the happenings in the world are sometimes overwhelming for me. And often when I’m in a bad headspace, I tend to do things that end up making me feel even worse. While I think it's important to stay informed, I have to remind myself that any one person can't carry the weight of the whole world on their shoulders, and I believe the world benefits most from us each realizing our own potential. So, there must be a balance between staying up-to-date and preserving enough mental bandwidth to be able to work towards daily goals and ultimately realizing your own potential.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Be aware of how your mood changes depending on the type of content you consume</h4>

<p>Everyone has control over what kind of and how much content they consume. Use this fact to your advantage! For example, if you find that spending time on Facebook often makes you feel worse than before, consciously decide to limit your time on Facebook. If reading an inspiring auto-biography makes you feel like you can conquer the world, consider reading 5-10 minutes during your Pomodoro practice breaks.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Realize that many platforms we spend too much time on are intentionally designed to be addicting</h4>

<p>Have you ever logged on to a social media platform and after a while, you&nbsp;want to log off, but for the life of you just can't seem to stop scrolling? Or you sit down to relax for a few minutes on your phone or in front of the TV or computer and before you know it, a few hours have passed? Let me tell you, that's not a mistake. The companies behind these apps, games, websites, and streaming services profit more off of you the more time you keep scrolling and clicking. News outlets run sensationalized stories to draw you in and get more views. Streaming platforms make more money off of you the more ads you watch and subscriptions you buy.</p>
    
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting everyone delete all their social media accounts or never watch TV ever again. These platforms can be useful in helping me relax, bond with friends over shared interests, or even in finding motivating content. The problem arises when these things interfere with our personal goals. When I find that I haven't been reaching my daily practice goals but <em>have</em> been conusming a lot of [insert media of choice here], I've had to ask myself: <strong>Is it worth sacrificing my time, mood, and productivity (which, combined, will ultimately play a large part in deciding <em>my own</em> earning capacity) to make some stranger rich?</strong> I've found that I have to work towards using these platforms consciously and intentionally. Which is why I've found it helpful to...</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Set time constraints on the media you consume</h4>

<p>As an Android user (don’t come for me), I've become a fan of using Digital Wellbeing settings to set timers on certain apps and websites I frequent. Looking at my time spent on my phone some days has been a humbling experience... so setting timers even just to be aware of how much time I'm spending on apps and websites is super helpful. iPhone users, do whatever it is you do!! ;)</p>

<p>Now let's break this whole thing down...</p>

<h1 class="section-heading">The Process, in Steps</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Think of your long-term goal. Is it to play in an orchestra? To be a soloist? Chamber musician? Come up with the steps it will take you to get there. How many hours a day will you need to practice? What school or teacher will help you get there? What techniques do you need to improve? What rep do you need to master?</li>
    <li>Evaluate where you are at. Be completely honest with yourself. If you haven&rsquo;t practiced for a month, you haven&rsquo;t practiced for a month. If you planned to practice 4 hours today but only ended up doing 20 minutes, then that&rsquo;s what happened. If you planned to practice 2 hours and practiced 3, great! No judgment. Don&rsquo;t estimate, either. Don&rsquo;t round up your time spent practicing because you&rsquo;re embarrassed. Be radically accepting of yourself. There are only things that work and things that don&rsquo;t work.</li>
    <li>Try some of the methods suggested here. I can almost guarantee you it won&rsquo;t go perfectly, or they might not fit to your schedule or preference. That&rsquo;s part of the process!</li>
    <li>Notice patterns that lead to either more practicing or less practicing. Approach this step with a sense of curiosity. What worked, and what didn&rsquo;t? Why or why not? Take the things that worked, and plan to incorporate them for the next day. Take the things that didn&rsquo;t work, and plan to try out a different approach.</li>
    <li>Get a good night&rsquo;s rest, then execute the plan you made for the day to the best of your ability.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 2-5 until you&rsquo;re consistently maintaining your daily goals. Accept that it may never be perfect but remember that by working to improve, you are beating your old self by miles. This will almost certainly show in your practice log: even if you don&rsquo;t hit your daily goal every day, your total practice time (and self-satisfaction) will almost certainly increase over time. Be proud of the fact that you are putting in effort to improve!</li>
</ol>
