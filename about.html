<p>Hi, I'm Julia! I am a graduate flute student with a goal of playing professionally in an orchestra. The day-to-day, nuts and bolts side of classical music and the many paths to becoming a professional musician is something my mind is always occupied with. In lessons and at school we learn about techniques to improve how we sound on our instrument, but less often about the day-to-day process it takes to reach our goals. I write about my journey of improving my flute playing and working towards reaching my professional goals, and I hope that in sharing what I learn on my journey, I can help you along yours.</p>
